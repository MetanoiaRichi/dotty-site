                    We knew movies rated high on the list of our target’s interests and, with incredible beaches, seaplanes, yachts and glamorous locations, the Whitsundays is the perfect setting for a movie.<br><br>
                    So we invited Australians to write it:
                </p>

                <h1 class="text-xl md:text-5xl font-semibold my-6">
                    The Whitsundays.<br>
                    A movie that’s waiting to be written.
                </h1>

                <p class="text-sm leading-6">We enlisted world-renowned screenwriter Craig Pearce as Script Supervisor. Then for 20 days we posted a daily storyboard image on Facebook and Instagram, inviting the public to write scenes for a chance to win a $10,000 luxury holiday.</p>

                <p class="text-sm leading-6">
                    The campaign launched with a trailer, radio and online advertising.<br><br>
                    We reacted to the storyline as it developed, selecting and treating images according to the previous winning scene.<br><br>
                    Each scene written and shared became a compelling “ad” for the Whitsundays.<br><br>
                    Together, a Hollywood screenwriter and the Australian public had created the world’s first crowd-sourced movie storyboard and a story universe with millions of possible permutations.
